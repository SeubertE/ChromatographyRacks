# ChromatographyRacks
These racks were designed for the Institute for Protein Design to hold gravity chromatography columns over Nalgene Unwire racks.

## How to Make and Assemble the Custom Institute of Protein Design (IPD) Chromatography Rack System
Prepared by Eugene Seubert, Student Research Assistant - Institute for Protein Design, University of Washington – Seattle Last Revised October 2020
##Objective
The purpose of this instruction manual is to make and assemble a custom designed acrylic rack to hold chromatography columns. Existing products are expensive and incompatible with the commonly used Nalgene wire racks during Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC). Student assistants at the Institute for Protein Design (IPD) who have experience in engineering or rapid prototyping can use this manual to make these racks at any time. Plan ahead to order materials and allocate enough time to cut parts if made inhouse. These instructions only give basic procedures on how to manufacturer and assemble the racks, they do not provide information about how to use or repair them.

## Background
These racks can be easily made either in a makerspace inhouse or outsources to be assembled after being shipped to the IPD. There are few materials and background concepts that you need to efficiently produce high quality racks.
### Required Items for Inhouse Manufacturing
• Computer Controlled Cutting Method (such as Laser Cutter or CNC router)
• Sheets of 0.25 in Thick Cast Acrylic
• Included Files (Technical Drawings, DXFs, and Vectors)
• Autodesk Inventor 2020
• Autodesk Project Files (IPTs and IAMs)
• (Optional) UV Printer
• (Optional) Plastic\Rubber Mallet
• (Optional) Acrylic Cement
### Required Items for Outsourced Manufacturing
• Included Files (Technical Drawings, DXFs, and Vectors)
• (Optional) Plastic\Rubber Mallet
• (Optional) Acrylic Cement

## Required Concepts
To manufacture these racks in house, you must be familiar and have access to a makerspace with a cutting method. You must also understand how to use Autodesk Inventor 2020 and operate the cutting method.
Autodesk Inventor tutorials can be found in the app or on the Autodesk Inventor website (https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/inventor/learn?sort=score).

For tutorials on laser cutting, routing, or other cutting methods, consult the instruction manual included with the equipment. Most makerspaces have quick references and classes to teaching the basics of using different cutting methods.
General Cautions and Warnings CAUTION Use eye protection when assembling. CAUTION When handling acrylic cement, follow the safety precautions as outlined in the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) supplied with the cement. Most SDSs for acrylic cement recommend skin protection and splash protection by wearing goggles and gloves. Keep away from flammable sources. WARNING Do not use solvents (i.e. ethanol, methanol, or acetone) to clean the rack. Only use warm soapy water.

## Procedure
### Manufacturing Racks
#### Option 1: Inhouse Manufacturing
1. Determine how much material is required. Based on how many racks you are manufacturing; you will need to calculate how much material will be required. Cut List software, such as Cut List Optimizer (https://www.cutlistoptimizer.com/), will optimize cut arrangement and material usage.
2. Prepare files for cutting. This step is dependent on cutting method. Use the project Autodesk Part files to generate DWGs with layouts of the cuts. Generally, laser cutters prefer a red line of 0.001 in thickness to designate a through cut. Set the line thickness and color in Autodesk appropriate to your cutting system. See Appendix B for an example of a cut file.
3. Cut using either a laser cutter or CNC mill. Send cut files to either the laser cutter or CNC mill, depending on which method is avaliable to you. Instructions on operating a laser cutter or CNC mill is outside the scope of this manual. WARNING ENSURE THE CUTTING METHOD IS CALIBRATED PROPERLY. LASER CUTTERS MUST HAVE THEIR FOCUS ADJUSTED PROPERLY IN ORDER FOR THESE PARTS TO FIT PROPERLY.
4. Optional: UV Print logo on side piece. Instructions on operating a UV printer are outside the scope of this manual. Image files, including vector files, are apart of the included files. See figure 3 for an example of a logo being UV printed on one of the side panels. Make sure the orientation of the print is as desired.

#### Option 2: Outsourcing Manufacturing
1. Find contacts of plastics manufacturers. There are many plastic manufacturers, both local and national. Most will have both laser cutting and routing capabilities.
a. TAPS Plastics is a manufacturer the IPD has contracted in the past and is a popular plastics supplier.
2. Send ZIP file of engineering drawings and DXFs to manufacturers for quotes. See Appendix C for a sample email on requesting a quote.
3. Compare quotes and select manufacturer to purchase from. See Appendix D for a sample of a quote comparison table.
4. Ask the selected manufacturer for a PDF of an invoice, if not already provided. Make sure the PDF includes the address and contact information for the accounts\billing department of the manufacturer.
5. Send invoice through the IPD “Lab Order Form”. Expect the manufacturer to take up to two weeks to cut and ship the racks.

### Assembling Racks
1. Slide the two sides into the top shelf, only a quarter of an inch. See Figure 4.
2. Slide the two sides into the bottom shelf, only a quarter of an inch. See Figure 5.
3. Simultaneously seat both sides into shelf. Use gentle taps from a plastic mallet if avaliable. Using the binding from an old textbook can substitute. See Figure 6. CAUTION DO NOT USE CONSTANT FORCE OR PRESSURE TO SEAT SIDES INTO SHELF. USING CONSTANT PRESSURE MAY CRACK ACRYLIC.
4. Slide bottom brace into sides, only a quarter of an inch. See Figure 7.
5. Seat the bottom brace into the slides. Use forceful taps from a plastic mallet. Using the binding from an old textbook can substitute. See Figure 8. CAUTION DO NOT USE CONSTANT FORCE OR PRESSURE TO SEAT BOTTOM BRACKET INTO SIDES. USING CONSTANT PRESSURE MAY CRACK ACRYLIC.
6. Optional: For permanent install, use acrylic cement to weld acrylic pieces together.

## Summary
With the rack fully assembled, it is ready to be deployed for use in the IPD. Although a lot of effort is made to create fabricate these parts, it still saves the IPD over $300 compared to existing solutions. Be careful with any solvents around the rack as acrylic can be dissolved in solutions of alcohols. To clean the rack, only use warm soapy water.
